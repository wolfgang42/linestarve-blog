This post is a bit complex to create.
All of the content is in python-3d-rendering.md.literate;
this file is read by _generate.js to produce the output files.

The generated files are:
* The post itself
* The contents of `figure/`
* `buildshape.py`

`buildshape.py` then outputs `shape.scad`, which is rendered into `shape.stl`.
