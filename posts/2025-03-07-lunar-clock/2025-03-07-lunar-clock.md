<img src="/blog/post/lunar-clock/lunar-clock.jpeg" width="480" height="480" style="display:block;margin:0 auto" alt="A small dark blue alarm clock, with the face showing the phases of the moon, and a single hand (currently pointing to the first quarter, just past Waxing Gibbous)."/>

Made with: [Braun BC02BL travel alarm clock](https://braun-clocks.com/products/bc02-classic-travel-analogue-alarm-clock-blue), [Gepetto Electronics lavet motor clock movement controller board](https://www.tindie.com/products/nsayer/crazy-clock/) with lunar clock firmware, custom designed replacement clock face.

The original controller board was an integral part of the clock movement, so I left it in place, but cut the power to it and rerouted it to the replacement board, which I crammed into a small bit of empty space inside the case. The minute hand has been removed, and the “hour” hand now goes around every 29.530 days (which makes it really annoying to tell if the battery is dead, since it only ticks one “second” in every ~59).

This has no practical purpose for me, but it was a fun exercise in graphic design (plus a bit of soldering practice), and it makes a neat-looking conversation piece.
