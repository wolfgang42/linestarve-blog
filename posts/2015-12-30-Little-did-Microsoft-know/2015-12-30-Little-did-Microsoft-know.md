I found this image on the back of a Microsoft booklet from 1991 called *Microsoft products for the Macintosh*. This same book contains other gems such as:

> My success at breeding captive animals can mean the difference between their survival or extinction. **That's why I use Microsoft Mail.**

Grant Hutchinson [noted](http://www.splorp.com/archives/2000_09_01_archive.html):

> Keep in mind that in this particular situation, the transaction would be based on the unit values present in the 1991 herring market. The same transaction today would need to have the equivalent herring value calculated at the current rate of exchange.
