If you get this message when you run `gulp`,
you have installed [`devour`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devour)
which also provides a `gulp` executable that wraps Gulp and prints this message.


I was having problems building some assets for a project,
and eventually discovered this after a *lot* of hair-tearing
trying to figure out why nothing was building.
Hopefully the search engines will pick up on this and give
more useful results to the next person who has this problem.
